      original_backgrounds_descriptions:
        corporate_execs: >-
          Wealthy, powerful, with servants, luxury homes, and the best of everything.
          Private security made sure you were always safe. 
          You definitely went to a big-name private school.
        corporate_managers: >-
          Well to do, with large homes, safe neighborhoods, nice cars, etc. Sometimes your 
          parent(s) would hire servants, although this was rare. You had a mix of private 
          and corporate education.
        corporate_technicians: >-
          Middle-middle class, with comfortable conapts or Beaverville suburban homes,
          minivans and corporate-run technical schools. Kind of like living 1950s America 
          crossed with 1984.
        nomad_pack: >-
          You had a mix of rugged trailers, vehicles, and huge road kombis for your home.
          You learned to drive and fight at an early age, but the family was always 
          there to care for you. Food was actually fresh and abundant. Mostly home schooled.
        ganger_family: >-
          A savage, violent home in any place the gang could take over. You were usually 
          hungry, cold, and scared. You probably didn't know who your actual parents were. 
          Education? The Gang taught you how to fight, kill, and steal—what else did you 
          need to know?
        combat_zoners: >-
          A step up from a gang "family," your home was a decaying building somewhere in 
          the “Zone”, heavily fortified. You were hungry at times, but regularly could score 
          a bed and a meal. Home schooled.
        urban_homeless: >-
          You lived in cars, dumpsters, or abandoned shipping modules. If you were lucky. 
          You were usually hungry, cold, and scared, unless you were tough enough to fight 
          for the scraps. Education? School of Hard Knocks.
        megastructure_warren_rats: >-
          You grew up in one of the huge new megastructures that went up after the War. 
          A tiny conapt, kibble and scop for food, a mostly warm bed. Some better educated 
          adult warren dwellers or a local Corporation may have set up a school.
        reclaimers: >-
          You started out on the road, but then moved into one of the deserted ghost towns 
          or cities to rebuild it. A pioneer life: dangerous, but with plenty of simple 
          food and a safe place to sleep. You were home schooled if there was anyone who had 
          the time.
        edgerunners: >-
          Your home was always changing based on your parents' current “job”. Could be a 
          luxury apartment, an urban conapt, or a dumpster if you were on the run. Food and 
          shelter ran the gamut from gourmet to kibble.
